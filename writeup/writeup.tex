\section*{Introduction}
This report mainly cover how to implement a "Einstein-Marilyn" (or a "dog-cat") picture, by image filtering and hybrid images. In this task we abandon the matlab's \textit{imfilter} function but to rewrite our own \textit{my\_filter} function.


\section*{Procedure}
The most important task is to implement a filter that does convolution. \\But... What is a convolution? 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Read image and filter information first.
	\item Pad the image to a larger size for convolution.
	\item Rotate 180Â° and place the filter at the origin.
	\item Do convolution, the current pixel's value is the sum of all neighbours and filter's dot product, in each color channel.
	\item Move the filter row by row, column by column, s.t. its center covers every pixel.
	\item Ok, got the new image!
\end{itemize}
If you want a math explanation of what I have done, here it comes:
\begin{equation}
g=f*h
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
g(i,j)=\sum_{k,l}f(i-k,j-l)h(k,l)=\sum_{k,l}f(k,l)h(i-k,j-l)
\end{equation}
:)

\section*{Interesting Implementation Detail}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] \textbf{What is the upper bond and the lower bond?}\\
	Boundary handling can be tricky as the filter can't be centered on pixels. So we implement a new function called \textit{fil} to help us read the surrounding pixel's value of a pixel with the size of filter and do dot product.
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
	
function new_pixel_val = fil(data, input_image, filter)
filter_height = size(filter,1);
filter_width = size(filter,2);

colors = data(3);

row_low = data(1) - floor(filter_height/2);
col_low = data(2) - floor(filter_width/2);
row_upp = data(1) + floor(filter_height/2);
col_upp = data(2) + floor(filter_width/2);

sub_mat = input_image(row_low:row_upp, col_low:col_upp, colors);

new_pixel_val = sum(sum(sub_mat.*filter));
end
	\end{lstlisting}
	In this we do not touch the original picture, but to copy the values we need to \textbf{sub\_mat}, and do dot product.
	\item[(b)] \textbf{What's the difference between convolution and correlation filter?}
	\\
	First, their names are different.\\
	Second, their equation are different.\\
	\begin{equation}
	g=f\otimes h
	\end{equation}
	i.e.
	\begin{equation}
g(i,j)=\sum_{k,l}f(i+k,j+l)h(k,l)
	\end{equation}
	Third, their final result may be different.
\end{itemize}
